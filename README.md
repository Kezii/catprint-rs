# catprint

You know it, the weird cat printer from AliExpress etc.

This is an implementation of device discovery and the protocol in Rust. It comes with a `catprint` CLI util to feed the paper and print arbitrary images with different dithering algorithms available (or none/K-mean if you prefer).
